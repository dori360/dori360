### 🚀 About Me

*   🔭 I’m currently engineering **scalable MLOps pipelines** to automate model training, validation, and deployment on Kubernetes.
*   🧠 My core research interests are in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, particularly with transformer architectures and efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, QLoRA).
*   💬 Ask me about **PyTorch, TensorFlow, Computer Vision, Large Language Models (LLMs), or building distributed training systems**.
*   📫 You can reach me at: **[rodivad@proton.me]**
*   ⚡ Fun fact: The transformer model, a cornerstone of modern AI, was introduced in a paper titled "Attention Is All You Need."
